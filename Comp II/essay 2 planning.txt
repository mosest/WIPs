OKAY LET'S TEXT JACOB

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WE BOTH:
	- 	don't really remember learning to read?? which i guess means
		that we learned to read at a young age because both of our
		families value education??
		
	- 	ar points!
		
	-	THINGS WE BOTH GREW UP WITH (LIKE, WHEN WE WERE SMOL)
	
		read berenstein bears growing up? i think? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
		ABOUT JACOB FUCK. also i know he played a shitload of pokemon,
		megaman, metroid, smash??? did he play smash when he was little?
		i know he had a gamecube. he played sunshine some... i mainly 
		watched, but i don't think either of us played when we were very
		VERY little. like, learning-to-read little
	
	-	READ A BUNCH OF BOOKS WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL.
		
		me..................both....................him.................	
		junie b jones		harry potter			star wars
		warriors									dune? he tried
		twilight (oh god)							i guess anything scifi
							The Cat Who series
		''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
		
		maybe there's a list of things online, most popular books for 
		millenials or something? everybody likes writing about that shit.
		we could go through it together? would it matter???????? WOULD
		ANY OF IT MATTER?? ? ??? ????? ???
		
		well i guess we had different tastes. 
		
	-	are afraid of doing new things because what if we aren't good at
		it immediately (almost guaranteed): this is a thing that a lot
		of traditional overachievers have. this is also the worst.
		
		but i can't write about this! even though it's an overlying
		concept that we both have experience with, it's kind of.... like
		... off-topic? like, it covers more than writing. i guess i could
		talk about how it works with writing SPECIFICALLY, but i think
		that wasn't the reason he doesn't like writing. he doesnt like
		writing because it's shoved down his throat and he's bad at it.
		also, i don't dislike writing. i mean, i guess i do. it puts me
		in a panic, but WHY. IT'S NOT THE SAME PANIC AS JACOB. W A I T !
		i think it might be!! but i got over it a little bit. what kind 
		of panic is it? writer's-block-fear panic? fear-that-i'll-do-
		a-bad-job panic? (<< that kind of panic would go well with the 
		traditional-overachiever thing)
		
	-	math for fun (who are we)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HE:
	-	doesn't like writing physically (or typing) because dysgraphia,
		doesn't like writing as a concept because (add?) i guess he doesn't
		think in a sentence format (but nobody does at first. school
		is meant to teach you how to take your jumblethoughts and put
		them into wordthoughts. but since he had a hard time with it
		physically, i guess it transferred into how he thinks about it
		:( poor jacob). but i'm into writing!
		
	-	is into scifi

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I:
	-	am more artistic than jacob? even though he has lots of ideas,
		he just doesn't really know how to express them. probably because
		he isn't as dextrous with his hands as me?? like, he has dysgraphia
		and i don't, so i'm automatically more predisposed to creating
		things out of my ideas than he is.
		
	-	wrote creatively, whereas i don't think he wrote at all unless
		he was in school
	
	-	am into poetry, whereas jacob is more no-nonsense? maybe if i
		picked out some poems he might like, he'd get into it. BUT WHAT
		POETRY WOULD HE EVEN LIKE??? i guess pablo neruda? is there any
		poet that writes scifi? NO WAIT HE LIKES BRUTAL STUFF. I BET
		I COULD FIND SOME ANGRY VIVID POETRY FOR HIM HEHE but he doesn't
		like things being cryptic. 
		
	-	play a lot of puzzle games, which rely on reading things
		carefully?? jacob likes games more for their playability than
		their storyline, but i know he appreciates and remembers the
		storylines of various megaman, metroid, etc games. he knows
		the backstory of basically all the characters he's played, and 
		also the backstories of those characters' friends and shit. wtf
		jacob
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SURVEY QUESTIONS EYYY

questions are about whether people think it's difficult to start something
(maybe most difficult to start, easy after that??)

also WHO TO ASK: as many people as possible, but ask for their gpa and 
whether they think they're overachievers or not????????

1. 	What is your cumulative college GPA? <box>

2. 	Would you describe yourself as an "overachiever" academically?

3. 	On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy is it for you to start doing something
	when you don't know how good you'll do at it? This can be starting a
	large paper/assignment, starting to learn how to do something new
	(guitar? crocheting? driving?), etc

4.	On a scale of 1 to 5, how anxious does writing a paper make you?

5.	Do you try to get everything right the first time when you write a
	paper, or do you write everything first and then edit?
	
6.	How do you edit? <Box>

in the paper we should mention how procrastination is a defense mechanism

intro (background info, research, thesis at end)
procedure (we talked to each other, we put out a survey)
results (the survey said ___ )
discussion (this is what that means)

question	: do overachievers have more anxiety writing than people whose
			  self-worth /doesn't/ depend on grades?
audience!!! : other overachievers?? teachers grading? people who care
			  about writers' block?
purpose 	: to tell people why they might have writers block, and also
			  to make sure they know why so they can fight it. heheheeheh
